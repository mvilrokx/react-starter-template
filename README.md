# Introduction
This is a starter template I created to create for my React.js projects. I use it to bootstrap my React.js project and so can you.

# Quick Start
## Development

1. Download this repository and unzip it.
2. Go to the folder you unzipped the project to and get all the npm dependencies:
```
$ npm install
```
3. Start the development server:
```
npm run dev
```
4. Open the application in your browser:
```
http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/
```

Start making changes to the JS and SCSS files and see them magically update in your browser (on file save)

## Production

1. Build the application:
```
npm run build
```
2. Copy the dist folder to your PROD server
3. Open the application in your browser:
```
http://<your-domain>/index.html
```
